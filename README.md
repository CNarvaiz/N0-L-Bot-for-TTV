# N0-L-Bot-for-TTV

Hi, and welcome to N0-L Bot! 

This is a hobby project of mine intended to assist me during my [Twitch.tv streams](https://www.twitch.tv/NoelleDay) and get me back in the habit of coding and using the GitHub workflow.

There isn't much here yet, especially here in the readme. 

Current Functionality and Goals
- [X] Responds to basic commands with text response
- [X] Does not infinite loop on herself
- [X] Case insensitive commands (Tentatively checked)
- [ ] Uptime check ~~Yes I'm aware it's a function on twitch already~~
- [ ] Subscription/Donation Alerts
- [ ] HTML object creation and control
